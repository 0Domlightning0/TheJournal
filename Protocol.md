# Protocol
A set of rules used to comminicate between parties 

## Real life example of I2C
- Uses time inbetween bursts of power using an internal clock 
- Uses mere milliseconds to tell the difference 
- Can run from 100kb/s to 400kb/s
- Programmed protocols remove human error and allow better memory of codes


## Our protocol 
- Using 3 flags we created a 4 trit system to call upon specific characters to be presetned
- Other trit commands to complete non character commans
- Simplicity = more accuracy / more time 
- Complexity = less accuracy / less time
-
